# create-google-review-link
Businesses can search for their Google Places listing and quickly generate a link their customers can use to leave a Google Review in one click.

1. Right now its just a very simple project I am working on in order to learn javascript
2. Several sections were copied from Google Places API documentation (to create the form with autocomplete)

To use, simply clone to your local machine, add your Google Places API key into index.html

Note: Aside from just being a simple project I am working on and not really meant for anyone to use, I am also aware that things like API key placement in the code are not best practices for security reasons. I am still learning things like this. For now, please just use on your own local machine. I will learn next how best to store API keys and use in applications. Thanks!
